My thinking behind developing this application was that since almost every person carries at least one cell phone, then why not use them to do something good for their minds? One of the best exercises for our minds is remembering and recalling things we have seen. So, Remember Me? is an exercise for your brain."

In each difficulty level, you will be shown a series of distinct emoticons (varying number of emoticons for each difficulty level) during a time period of 30 seconds. Your task is to remember these emoticons. At the end of 30 seconds, you will be presented with a random mix of emoticons (the count of emoticons shown here will be higher than the count of emoticons you have to remember) from which you have to select the ones that were shown to you.",

The lowest possible score is 0, so you cannot score in the negatives. There are no penalties for failing to recall emoticons. This is designed in such a way to discourage the users from selecting all the emoticons and scoring 100% every-time."
